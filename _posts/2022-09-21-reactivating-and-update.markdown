Right then,

OMG Where do I start?

I think the best way to discuss what I got up to would be to divide therm into 4 - gardening and food; exploring the Alps on bike and ski; my experiences as a middle aged bloke learning to code, and being prepared for the inevitable harder times we may face in the future - prepping in other words. I only offer a brief summary here. 

I have had a garden for years. Gardening is a craft and no matter what you may watch on *BBC Gardener's World* it is not actually that easy! If you have a medium sized garden, you are limited as to what works well, how much space to plant - some like zucchini need a huge area - and also the season is limited. Overcoming those limitations was and is a challenge. And once you get into the gardening subject, you invariably wish to go organic. I have begun to research methods of biodynamic gardening, also gardening ways from other places like Korea which we may need as times get harder. Also to save money, I wish to learn how to replicate the plant stock I have. If I can grow my own stock it will be a boon to others. I help others with their gardens - I look after five gardens in total including my own and my inlaws. 

When the "plague" hit a few years back, I decided to get in shape. The problem I faced was how? Gyms were closed for "hygiene" (beer shops weren't oddly). One of the biggest vitamins missing (certainly in China where those poor worker ants live in smog) was Vitamin D. So logically outdoor sports became important. I've always had a mountain bike for the local trails, so the idea came to explore the Alps with it on a bike carrier on the back of the car with my wife (the bike, not my wife)! This idea took on a life of its own and I'm a full blown mountain biker now out there. The picture above was taken on the "Soiernweg" trail we did this summer. What about winter? Well there are hundreds of kilometres of Nordic skiing trails also out there which I use regularly with my wife. We ski them and sip a flask of soup on a bench halfway round, most gratifying, then go home and lie by our log fire.

Many years ago when the Web began in 2000, one of the languages mentioned as the cool thing to be into was Java. Back then I purchased a DVD with a course on it. However, the quality of the language back then (Java 1.1) was, to be blunt, not that high. So I promptly sent it back and later regretted it! Years later, when Googling for an online course, I found a wonderful Brit John who allowed to learn from his amazing tutorials which I have been following every since. I'm really grateful to him for that opportunity, even if sometimes his lessons leave me baffled! :) Update: John's site has disappeared! What to do next ?

The toilet paper shortage in 2020 gave many their first taste of needing to be self-reliant. We've always had one half of the house heated by wood, but the other is gas central heating. What "wood" we do? We purchased a stand alone propane gas heater. This led us to question what energy sources we might use if for example the electric grid went down? What about food and water? Solar? Cooking? I have begun to get ready for these eventualities but God knows how effective they are going to be. 

Now the above may sound impresssive, however the yang to this yin was that in the middle of this, I ended up in hospital fighting to stay alive last autumn. Obviously, I won and that's a story to share later! :) But what it did for me was to remove any fear I may have had about going forth and entering new projects, which I'm happy to share here. The short time (ten days) gave me a new impetus to go out and get my family and I ready for the future. :)
